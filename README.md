Oxygen not Included Mods

--MaficIron mod adds a recipe to the Metal Refinery

100 Kg of Mafic Rock + 100 Kg of Regolith = 100 Kg of Iron

Best used with the Super Miner Mod https://github.com/javisar/ONI-Modloader-Mods/tree/master/Mods

Credits goes to @Rainbow, for his HotterThanLava mod https://github.com/rainbowdesign/OxygenNotIncluded-Mods, from which this mod was born.

--PipesMass mod boosts pipe capacity, edit the "liquid" **numeric** value in config. Affects both gas and liquid pumps.

Best used with the BuildingModifier Mod https://github.com/javisar/ONI-Modloader-Mods/tree/BuildingModifier/Mods  where you boost the **consumptionRate** of gas and liquid pumps like that:


"LiquidPump":{"Storage": {"capacityKg": <somenumber>},"ElementConsumer": {"consumptionRate": 100, "consumptionRadius":5}},
  
 "GasPump":{"Storage": {"capacityKg": <somenumber>},"ElementConsumer": {"consumptionRate": 100, "consumptionRadius":5}}
  
  
  

A big thanks to @trevice for helping me out in all.
