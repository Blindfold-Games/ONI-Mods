MaficIron mod adds a recipe to the Metal Refinery

100 Kg of Mafic Rock + 100 Kg of Regolith = 100 Kg of Iron

Best used with the Super Miner Mod https://github.com/javisar/ONI-Modloader-Mods/tree/master/Mods

Credits goes to @Rainbow, for his HotterThanLava mod https://github.com/rainbowdesign/OxygenNotIncluded-Mods, from which this mod was born.

PipesMass mod boosts pipe and sweeper capacity, edit the "liquidandgas" value in config for pipes (Affects both gas and liquid pipes) and "STA" for sweeper carry cap. Both are in Kg's.

**!!! ONI-Common.dll needed !!!** (https://github.com/javisar/ONI-Modloader-Mods/tree/master/Mods)

Best used with the BuildingModifier Mod https://github.com/javisar/ONI-Modloader-Mods/tree/BuildingModifier/Mods  where you boost the **consumptionRate** of gas and liquid pumps like that:


"LiquidPump":{"Storage": {"capacityKg": 100},"ElementConsumer": {"consumptionRate": 100, "consumptionRadius":5}},
  
 "GasPump":{"Storage": {"capacityKg": 100},"ElementConsumer": {"consumptionRate": 100, "consumptionRadius":5}}
